# IAMJABULANI

> IAMJABULANI started life as my statically generated portfolio/résumé site built on the Nuxt framework. During that process it grew into a useful starter project for rapid prototyping vue sites.

Want to try it out? Just clone this repo and then...

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
